# Classic Retro NDS Deltaskins

These are two deltaskins for Nintendo DS. "classicRetro.deltaskin" is a standard skin with both the top and bottom screens, but "classicRetroBottomScreen.deltaskin" has had the top screen removed. This is ideal for those who want to airplay the top screen or who want to play games that only require the bottom screen (such as Tetris DS) and would like to keep the extra screen space.

## How-to
In order to screencast the top screen of the DS to a Macbook or TV, you'll need to access the Nintendo DS core settings in Delta and toggle "Show Top Screen Only" on in the Airplay section. You may also need to set the player 2 controller to "Touch Screen".

## Acknowledgements
- The original layout of the skin (with both top and bottom screens) came from [mtcbx's DS skins](https://github.com/mtcbx/mtcbxDeltaSkin). I thought it was a great starting point to make my bottom screen only skin and figured I'd make a version of his with my color palette while I was at it
