# PSXlike GBA Deltaskin

This might be super niche but I love it. I'm a huge fan of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games for Playstation, and I love that they have a simpler 2.5D version on GBA. The only problem is the layout of a GBA with the shoulder buttons makes the game near unplayable on Delta without a controller. I created this original Playstation controller-inspired deltaskin which has the L and R buttons as action buttons along with A and B. It takes a bit of getting used to, especially navigating menus with A moved to the top, but it makes for a much better gaming experience than the shoulder buttons for realtime action games. This actually makes the controls for Tony Hawk Pro Skater the exact same as they are on the Playstation, with the left action button for flip tricks, top button for grind tricks, right button for grab tricks, and bottom button to jump and speed up. Hopefully someone else gets some use out of this. If there's any interest I was also considering making one that switches A and R, so A is in the expected position. This particular layout just works better for the games I play.

# Classic Retro NDS Deltaskins

These are two deltaskins for Nintendo DS. "classicRetro.deltaskin" is a standard skin with both the top and bottom screens, but "classicRetroBottomScreen.deltaskin" has had the top screen removed. This is ideal for those who want to airplay the top screen or who want to play games that only require the bottom screen (such as Tetris DS) and would like to keep the extra screen space. I also added "classicRetroTopScreen.deltaskin", which has had the bottom screen removed for games that only require the top one.

## How-to
In order to screencast the top screen of the DS to a Macbook or TV, you'll need to access the Nintendo DS core settings in Delta and toggle "Show Top Screen Only" on in the Airplay section. You may also need to set the player 2 controller to "Touch Screen".

## Acknowledgements
- The original layout of the skin (with both top and bottom screens) came from [mtcbx's DS skins](https://github.com/mtcbx/mtcbxDeltaSkin). I thought it was a great starting point to make my bottom screen only skin and figured I'd make a version of his with my color palette while I was at it
