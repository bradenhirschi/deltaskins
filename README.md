# Acknowledgements
- The original layout of the skin (with both top and bottom screens) came from [mtcbx's DS skins](https://github.com/mtcbx/mtcbxDeltaSkin). I thought it was a great starting point to make my bottom screen only skin and figured I'd make a version of his with my color palette while I was at it
